Configure organizations
Learn how to configure organizations in your supastarter application.

Disable organizations
To disable organizations, you can set the organizations.enabled flag to false in the config/index.ts. This will completely disable organizations and all related pages in the application.


const config = {
  organizations: {
    enabled: false,
  },
};
Require an organization
To require an organization for a user to be able to access the application, you can set the organizations.requireOrganization flag to true in the config/index.ts. This will lead to the user being asked to create an organization after signing up, if he hasn't been invited to an organization yet.


const config = {
  organizations: {
    requireOrganization: true,
  },
};
Hide organization selection
You can hide the organization selection in the UI by setting the organizations.hideOrganization flag to true in the config/index.ts. This can be useful if you want to build a multi-tenant application where users should only be member of one organization.


const config = {
  organizations: {
    hideOrganization: true,
  },
};
Disable organization creation
If users should be able to be member of multiple organizations, but not to create new organizations, you can set the organizations.enableUsersToCreateOrganizations flag to false.


const config = {
  organizations: {
    enableUsersToCreateOrganizations: false,
  },
};
Invite-only organizations
To get an invite-only organization setup, you can disable the signup of users:


const config = {
  auth: {
    enableSignup: false,
  },
};
