Tech Stack
Learn about the tech stack used in supastarter.

For a better understanding of the codebase, let's first go over the tools and libraries that supastarter uses and why we chose them.

Turborepo
TurboRepo is a monorepo tool that helps you manage your project's dependencies and scripts. We chose a monorepo setup to make it easier to manage to structure the different features and enable code sharing between the different packages. It also allows you to easily add further apps (like a mobile app or a different frontend) to the project and reuse the existing codebase.

Next.js
Next.js is a one of the most popular React frameworks. We use it for the frontend of supastarter and also utilize it's route handlers to serve the API for the application.

Prisma
Prisma is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that helps you access your database in a type-safe way. We use Prisma to define our database schema and to generate the necessary TypeScript types for our application. It also helps us to write queries in a type-safe way and to easily migrate our database schema.

Hono
Hono is a minimal web server framework that helps you to build the API for supastarter. It enables you to easily define routes and handle requests and responses. It runs on the edge, serverless functions or as a traditional "long-running" server, so you can use it in any environment and with any provider. It also comes with an RPC client that allows you to easily call your own functions from the frontend in a type-safe way.

Tanstack Query
Tanstack Query is a library for managing server state and fetching data in React applications. We use it to fetch data from the API and to manage the state of the application.

better-auth
better-auth is an authentication library that helps you to add authentication to your application. It's highly customizable and gives you full control over the authentication process and the user data, so you don't lock yourself into a specific provider.

Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that helps you build custom designs without writing any CSS. We use it to style the frontend of supastarter and to create a consistent design system.

Radix UI
Radix UI is a collection of headless UI components that help you build accessible and composable user interfaces. supastarter is also compatible with the popular wrapper of Radix called shadcn/ui and enables you to generate pre-designed components with a single command.

Content Collections
Content Collections is a markdown-based CMS that helps you manage your content in a structured way within your codebase. We use it to manage the content of the supastarter blog, the documentation and other content pages (like the legal pages) with MDX.
