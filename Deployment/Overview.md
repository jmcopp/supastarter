# Deployment Overview

Learn how to deploy supastarter's multi-container architecture in production.

## Multi-Container Deployment Strategy

Supastarter uses a **container-first approach** optimized for production deployments across multiple platforms. The architecture supports:

- **Container isolation** with dedicated frontend and API services
- **Independent scaling** based on service-specific requirements
- **Cost optimization** with scale-to-zero capabilities
- **Security hardening** with private internal networking

**Recommended Platform**: While supastarter can deploy anywhere that supports containers, **Fly.io** provides the optimal experience for the multi-container architecture.

## Deployment Platforms

### [Fly.io Multi-Container (Recommended)](Fly_io.md)
**Best for**: Production applications requiring security, scalability, and cost optimization
- Multi-container deployment with private networking
- Auto-scaling with scale-to-zero support
- Global edge deployment
- Estimated cost: $5-25/month

### [Docker Containerization](Docker.md)
**Best for**: Self-hosted deployments or custom container platforms
- Multi-stage Docker builds optimized for production
- Security hardening with non-root users
- Container orchestration ready

### Single-Container Platforms
*Note: These require architectural modifications for optimal performance*

**[Vercel](Vercel.md)**
- Next.js optimized but API limitations
- Serverless functions instead of dedicated API containers
- Best for frontend-heavy applications

**[Render](Render.md)**
- Docker support but single-container per service
- Good alternative to Fly.io
- Simpler setup but less optimization

**[Netlify](Netlify.md)**
- Static site deployment with serverless functions
- Limited backend capabilities
- Best for JAMstack applications

## Multi-Service Deployment

### Hybrid Platform Strategy
You can deploy frontend and API services on different platforms:

```
Frontend (Vercel) ↔️ API (Fly.io) ↔️ Database (Supabase)
```

**Benefits**:
- Optimize each service for its platform strengths
- Leverage platform-specific features
- Independent scaling and deployment cycles

**Considerations**:
- Cross-origin request configuration
- Latency between services
- More complex monitoring and debugging

### [Standalone API Deployment](Standalone_API.md)
**Best for**: Microservices architecture or API-first development
- Deploy FastAPI containers independently
- Multiple frontend applications
- API versioning and backwards compatibility

## Architecture Comparison

| Platform | Architecture | Scaling | Cost (Est.) | Complexity |
|----------|--------------|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Fly.io** | Multi-container | Auto + Scale-to-zero | $5-25/mo | Medium |
| **Docker + VPS** | Self-hosted containers | Manual | $10-50/mo | High |
| **Vercel** | Serverless functions | Automatic | $0-100/mo | Low |
| **Render** | Single containers | Auto | $7-25/mo | Medium |

## Security Considerations

### Production Security Checklist
- ✅ **HTTPS everywhere** with automatic certificates
- ✅ **Private API networking** (no public API endpoints)
- ✅ **JWT token validation** on all protected routes
- ✅ **Rate limiting** per user/IP
- ✅ **CORS configuration** for cross-origin requests
- ✅ **Environment secrets** properly managed
- ✅ **Database RLS policies** enabled and tested

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Health checks** for all services
- **Centralized logging** across containers
- **Performance metrics** and alerting
- **Error tracking** with Sentry integration

Choose your deployment platform based on your specific requirements, team expertise, and budget constraints.
