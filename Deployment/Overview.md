Overview
Learn how to deploy your supastarter application.

In general you can deploy the application to any hosting provider that supports Node.js. In this documentation we cover multiple deployment targets from serverless platforms like Vercel to self-hosted solutions with Docker.

Since Next.js is a framework built by Vercel, you will get the best developer experience when deploying to Vercel.

Deploy API as a service
As supastarter has a dedicated API layer, it also allows you to deploy your API as a dedicated service. This can be useful if you want to run your API and frontend on different platforms or if you want youc API to be a "long-running" service instead of a serverless deployment.
