Project structure
Learn how the supastarter codebase is structured.

supastarter uses a monorepo structure, which allows you to easily extend your project (for example with a mobile app) and share code and configs between applications.

Basic repository structure
By default the monorepo contains the following apps and packages:

apps – Main application (includes marketing pages and SaaS)
web
config – Configuration of the project
packages
auth – Authentication setup
api – API server (including all features logic)
database – Database setup
i18n – Translations and localization setup
mail – Mail templates and provider
storage – Storage providers and upload logic
util – Shared utilities and helpers
tooling – Configuration for the monorepo
eslint – ESLint config
tailwind – Tailwind config
typescript – TypeScript config
