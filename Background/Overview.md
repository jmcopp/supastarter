Overview
Learn how to create background tasks & cron jobs in your supastarter application.

With every larger application, you'll get to a point where you need to run tasks in the background or want to queue up or schedule tasks to be executed. This could be sending emails, processing images, or any other task that doesn't need to be done immediately, take too long for an API call, or need to be run at a specific time.

There are multiple approaches to implement tasks in your supastarter application.

Serverless environments
If you deploy your application in a serverless environment, you want to use a third-party service to schedule and trigger your tasks like trigger.dev or upstash:

trigger.dev
Upstash QStash
Self-hosted environments
If you have your backend deployed on a long-running server like described in our standalone API documentation, you can also use libraries like bullmq to create and schedule background tasks.
