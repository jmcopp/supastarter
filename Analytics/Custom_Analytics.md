Custom Analytics
Learn how to use a custom analytics provider with supastarter.

To use a custom analytics provider with supastarter, first make sure you have the url of the tracking script.

Then, if you need to pass any environment variables with the script, add them to the .env.local file and your deployment environment:


NEXT_PUBLIC_MY_CUSTOM_ANALYTICS_KEY=your_key_here
Next, we need to activate your analytics provider. To do this, open apps/web/modules/analytics/index.tsx and change the content to:


export * from "./provider/custom";
To customize the custom analytics configuration, edit the apps/web/modules/analytics/provider/custom/index.tsx.

For further instructions, follow the general analytics instructions.
