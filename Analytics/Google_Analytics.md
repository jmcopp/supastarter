Google Analytics
Learn how to use Google Analytics with supastarter.

To use Google Analytics with supastarter, first create a Google Analytics account and grab your analytics id.

Then, add the app code to your .env.local file and your deployment environment:


NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=your_id_here
Next, we need to activate Google Analytics as the analytics provider. To do this, open apps/web/modules/analytics/index.tsx and change the content to:


export * from "./provider/google";
To customize the Google Analytics configuration, edit the apps/web/modules/analytics/provider/google/index.tsx.

For further instructions, follow the general analytics instructions.
