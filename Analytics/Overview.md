Overview
Learn how to use analytics in supastarter.

supastarter comes with a generic analytics module that enables you to integrate analytics providers and track custom events.

Setup analytics
In the apps/web/modules/analytics/index.ts file, export the provider file of the provider you want to use:


export * from "./provider/google";
// or export * from './provider/mixpanel';
// or export * from './provider/pirsch';
// or export * from './provider/plausible';
// or export * from './provider/umami';
// or export * from './provider/vercel';
// or export * from './provider/posthog';
// or export * from './provider/custom';
To learn how to set up your analytics provider, check out the respective documentation:

Custom
Analytics script component
The analytics script component that is part of the provider file you exported in the first step is automatically included in the application:

apps/web/modules/shared/components/Document.tsx

export function Document({ children }: PropsWithChildren) {
	return (
		<html>
			<body>
				{children}
				<AnalyticsScript />
			</body>
		</html>
	);
}
Now your app will include the analytics script and track page views.

Track custom events
To track custom events, import the useAnalytics hook and use the trackEvent function:


import { useAnalytics } from "@analytics";
 
export function YourComponent() {
  const { trackEvent } = useAnalytics();
 
  return (
    <button onClick={() => trackEvent("button-clicked", { value: "asdf" })}>
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}
The trackEvent function takes two arguments:

event: The name of the event
data: An object containing additional data about the event
