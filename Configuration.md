Configuration
Learn how to configure your supastarter application.

supastarter is a highly flexible and customizable starter kit and allow you to configure the project to your needs. You can find the main config file in the config/index.ts file in the repository.

This section will cover all configuration options and when to use them.

Config file
You can find the configuration object in the config/index.ts file in the repository.

		},
	},
};
Use cases
The configuration options enable you to set up lots of different use cases. Here are some examples:

Deploy marketing page only
If you want to deploy the marketing page only, you can set the ui.saas.enabled option to false. This will disable the saas part of the application and redirect requests to the marketing page.


export const config = {
    // ...
    ui: {
        saas: {
            enabled: false,
        },
    },
};
To not have to manually set this option while developing locally, you can define an environment variable NEXT_PUBLIC_SAAS_ENABLED in your .env file and use this in the file file.


export const config = {
    // ...
    ui: {
        saas: {
            enabled: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SAAS_ENABLED === "true",
        },
    },
};
This way you can set the deployed version to false while enabling the development version to true.

Disable marketing page
If you want to ship the marketing page separately and just use the SaaS part of supastarter, you can simply disable the marketing part of the application. This will redirect all requests to the SaaS part or the login page if the user is not authenticated.


export const config = {
    // ...
    ui: {
        marketing: {
            enabled: false,
        },
    },
};
Multi-tenant application
If you want to use supastarter as a multi-tenant application, you can use the following configuration. This will

require users to be in an organization
hide the organization from the user
redirect users to the organization page after sign in

export const config = {
    // ...
    organizations: {
        hideOrganization: true,
        requireOrganization: true,
        enableUsersToCreateOrganizations: false,
    },
};
With this setup, you can have two different behaviors for creating organizations.

Users can create an initial organizations (and no further)
Only admins can create organizations
To enable the second behavior, you can set the auth.enableSignup option to false. This way users can only join if they are invited to an organization and organizations can only be created by admins.


export const config = {
    // ...
    auth: {
        enableSignup: false,
    },
};
Enable/disable onboarding
There is a prepared onboarding form, which allows users to set up their profile after sign up. If you want to disable it, you can set the users.enableOnboarding option to false.


export const config = {
    // ...
    users: {
        enableOnboarding: false,
    },
};
Attach billing to users or organizations
You can attach billing to users or organizations. To enable this for either one, you can set the enableBilling option to true.


export const config = {
    // for users
    users: {
        enableBilling: true,
    },
    // for organizations
    organizations: {
        enableBilling: true,
    },
};
In theory, you can have both enabled at the same time, but for most use cases you want to attach it to only one of them.

Disable organizations
If you don't want to use organizations, you can set the organizations.enable option to false. This will disable the organizations feature totally.


export const config = {
    // ...
    organizations: {
        enable: false,
    },
};
Customize authentication
You can easily (de)activate authentication methods like social login, passkeys, password login and magic links.


export const config = {
    // ...
    auth: {
        enableSocialLogin: false,
        enablePasskeys: false,
        enablePasswordLogin: false,
        enableMagicLink: false,
    },
};
