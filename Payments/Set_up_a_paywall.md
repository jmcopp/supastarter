Set up a paywall
Learn how to set up a paywall for your supastarter application.



Per default, supastarter has includes a free plan which means that users can access your application after signing up without any payment.

If your SaaS should not be accessible for free or only with a trial of a paid plan, you can set up a paywall.

All you need to do is to remove the plan with isFree: true from the configuration file.

config/index.ts

export const config = {
  payments: {
    plans: {
        free: { 
            isFree: false, 
        }, 
        // ...
    }
  },
}
This will remove the free plan and redirect the users to the /app/choose-plan page after the signup (and the onboarding flow).
