Nodemailer
Learn how to use Nodemailer for sending emails.

To use Nodemailer with supastarter, make sure you have an SMTP server available, that you can send mails from.

Add the following environment variables to your .env.local file and your deployment environment:

.env.local

MAIL_HOST="your-mail-host"
MAIL_PORT="your-mail-port"
MAIL_USER="your-mail-user"
MAIL_PASS="your-mail-password"
Then, make sure to activate Nodemailer in the /packages/mail/src/provider/index.ts:


export * from './nodemailer';
To customize the provider, edit the packages/mail/src/provider/nodemailer/index.ts.

For further instructions, follow the general mail instructions.
